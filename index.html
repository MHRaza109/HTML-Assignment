<P> <B><i><u>Good descriptive</u></i></b> paragraphs take into account the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sound and sight. Though sight is often considered the first thing a writer notices, sometimes it is best in writing a descriptive paragraph to leave this detail to the end.
Instead, start with something less obvious, such as smell or taste.<br/>After this the writer can describe what something feels and sounds like.<hr/> 
Using varied descriptive words also helps a reader better understand the subject being described. <hr/> </p>
